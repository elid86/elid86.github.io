The purpose of this web application is to view and compare the amount of coffee exported from the top coffee export countries. Countries were determined based on which had exported at least 1,000 units in a year between 1990-2017. This came to be 22 countries in total. 
There are two tabs to the website: the comparison tab, to allow users to compare each of the selected countries on one graph, and the individuals tab, to show the flow of each country better by placing it on a scale of its own range. 

Some interesting things found:

1. Most countries are under 5,000 units a year
So many countries participate in coffee exports yet most don't produce more than 5,000 units a year. This may seem like a lot but in comparison to Brazil, Colombia and Vietnam's exports, this is quite small. 

2. Vietnam's late start
We are able to see that Vietnam didn't actually begin exporting coffee until the late 1980's, yet it only took around 20 years to become one of the top exporters. They even hit a high of over 25,000 units where most countries don't ever reach even 5,000 units. 

3. Brazil's deep plunge
In 1986 we see that Brazil took a deep plunge and, after some research, I found this was due to the effects of a great drought that caused serious concern for the country and resulted in a great increase in prices for coffee all over the world. It even placed the International Coffee Organization's control over quota's into suspention until things were under control and agreements were renegotiated.
